# Add Two Numbers - Linked List Solution
## Overview ðŸš€

Welcome to the "Add Two Numbers" repository! This repository contains a robust and efficient solution for adding two non-negative integers represented by two non-empty linked lists. The numbers are stored in reverse order, with each node of the linked list representing a single digit. This README will guide you through the intricacies of the solution, its implementation, and how you can utilize it in your projects.  
## Problem Statement ðŸ§©
 
Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers, where the digits are stored in reverse order and each node contains a single digit, your task is to add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
 
## Example:  

    Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)  
    Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8  
    Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

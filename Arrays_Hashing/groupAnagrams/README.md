# Group Anagrams  ðŸ“š
##  Welcome to the Group Anagrams repository! This is a fun and engaging project that involves grouping words into anagrams. An anagram, as we know, is a cool linguistic play where you rearrange the letters of a word to create another word or phrase. This codebase offers a solution to group such anagrams together in a given array of strings.

## Problem Statement ðŸ§©
Given an array of strings strs, the goal is to group the anagrams together. The output is flexible and can be in any order.

### Examples:
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
### Constraints ðŸ”—
1 <= strs.length <= 10^4
0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

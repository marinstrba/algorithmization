# UniqueElementsInArray

Welcome to the UniqueElementsInArray repository! ðŸš€ This repository hosts a highly efficient and intuitive solution for processing sorted integer arrays to remove duplicates. Our goal is to ensure each unique element appears exactly once, while maintaining the original order of these elements.  
## Introduction ðŸ“–

In many applications, especially involving data processing and analysis, it's crucial to work with sets of unique elements. This repository offers a robust implementation to handle such scenarios, specifically focusing on non-decreasing sorted integer arrays.
## Features âœ¨

In-Place Deduplication: Our algorithm skillfully modifies the array in place, saving memory and increasing efficiency.  
Order Preservation: The relative order of unique elements is   maintained, ensuring data integrity.  
Optimized Performance: Tailored for optimal speed and low memory   usage, making it suitable for large datasets.

Welcome to the Reversing a Singly Linked List project! This repository houses a simple, yet powerful implementation to reverse a singly linked list. If you're diving into data structures, especially linked lists, this repository is a fantastic resource! ðŸš€  

## Overview ðŸ“š
Linked lists are fundamental data structures in computer science, widely used for their simplicity and efficiency in certain operations. A singly linked list is a type of linked list where each node points only to the next node in the sequence, with the last node pointing to null. This project implements a function to reverse a singly linked list, transforming the direction of the pointers so that the last node becomes the first.

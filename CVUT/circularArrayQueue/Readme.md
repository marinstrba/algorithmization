# CircularArrayQueue ðŸ”„

Welcome to the CircularArrayQueue repository! This Java  library provides a robust implementation of a queue data  structure using a circular array. It's perfect for those  looking to efficiently manage a fixed-size collection of  elements with dynamic enqueue and dequeue operations.  
## Features âœ¨

Fixed-Size Array Backing: Utilizes a fixed-size array to  store the queue elements, ensuring efficient memory usage. 
Circular Mechanism: Smartly handles the front and rear of  the queue to optimize space and operation time, especially  useful in repeated enqueue and dequeue scenarios. 
Dynamic Capacity: While defaulting to a capacity of 5, it  allows you to create a queue of any specified size.  
Essential Queue Operations: Implements all the essential  queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty, isFull, and a method to print all elements.

# BruteForceAttacker Project

Welcome to the BruteForceAttacker project! 🚀 This repository contains a Java-based solution for cracking a safe using the brute force attack method. Ideal for educational purposes, this project provides a deep dive into the mechanics of password cracking and recursive   programming. Let's unlock the secrets together! 🔐💻  
## Project Overview 🌟

In this intriguing challenge, you've stumbled upon test assignments  from PJV (Programming Language Java). These tests are locked in a safe with an electronic lock, and your mission is to crack it open using  your computer and a series of potential passwords. The primary focus  is on implementing a brute force attack, a method where every possible combination of characters is tried until the correct password is found.
## Key Components:

    Test: This class is provided for testing your algorithm. 
    Thief: This class represents the entity attempting to break into  the safe.  
    BruteForceAttacker: This is where you'll contribute. You need to  complete the breakPassword(int sizeOfPassword) method to crack the password.

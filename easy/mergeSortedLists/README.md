# Merged Linked Lists README 🌐

Welcome to the Merged Linked Lists repository! This repository offers a seamless solution to a classic problem in computer science and data structures: merging two sorted linked lists into a single, sorted linked list. Perfect for computer science students, coding enthusiasts, and professionals, this codebase demonstrates an elegant approach to a common algorithmic challenge.
## What's Inside? 📦

    Algorithm Implementation: A well-designed algorithm that efficiently merges two sorted linked lists.
    Test Cases: Examples and test cases, including edge cases, to validate the correctness of the algorithm.
    Documentation: Comprehensive documentation that explains the logic, implementation details, and usage instructions.

## How It Works 🔍

The core algorithm in this repository merges two input linked lists, list1 and list2, which are already sorted. It splices together the nodes of these two lists to form a new sorted linked list. This is done in a way that maintains the sorted order of the elements.
## Examples 📝

    Example 1:  
        Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]  
        Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]  
    Example 2:  
        Input: list1 = [], list2 = []  
        Output: []  
    Example 3:  
        Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]  
        Output: [0]

# Find Median from Two Sorted Arrays README

Welcome to the "Find Median from Two Sorted Arrays" repository! ðŸŒŸ This unique algorithm is designed to efficiently calculate the median of two sorted arrays, ensuring optimal performance with a time complexity of O(log(m+n)). It's the perfect blend of efficiency and accuracy for handling sorted arrays.  
## Introduction ðŸš€

Finding the median in a single array is straightforward, but when it comes to two sorted arrays, the complexity increases. This repository contains a solution that not only finds the median efficiently but does so in a way that scales logarithmically with the size of the input arrays. This makes it ideal for large datasets.
